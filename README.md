# Create files using Deno JS: 

## A crude  example

1. Create a json file and populate it with some information
2. For more practical purposes, send a `GET` to an API that returns json
3. Depending on the kind of info you want to save to different files, create your variables
4. Use template literals to format your string as you'ld like

> Once you're satisfied with the format, proceed

To generate files from your json file. Run the following:

`deno run --allow-read --allow-write index.ts`
